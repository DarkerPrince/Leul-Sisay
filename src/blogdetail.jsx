                  It is estimated that more than 3 million Ethiopians reside
                  abroad. North America, Europe, and the Gulf are Ethiopian
                  migrants' top destinations. Most of the time, they find it
                  tough to find ways to assist their loved ones, and most of the
                  time it takes longer time, and about 90% of them have
                  relatives living inside of Ethiopia, which they support by any
                  form of income they gained there. The majority of them
                  struggle with how to transmit any kind of assistance, like
                  money, documents, or in our case, cell top-up platforms,
                  across the country. However, there are some that can aid them
                  with this process but are a bit challenging for them to use.

                  I discovered a website called [Ding] that aids those other
                  nations in assisting them in resolving the issues they were
                  having, in showing their love and support for those in need
                  by, among other things, providing them with gifts that include
                  mobile top-ups from their country, which will greatly benefit
                  them and make them smile. This sample design is simply a copy
                  of the website changed into a mobile application, which I had
                  the opportunity to register for and use a few times. It's a
                  wonderful way to support your family and a kind gesture. Once
                  you enter their phone number on the app, sending a mobile
                  top-up to your loved ones living in Ethiopia takes just one
                  click. You can even send them money on a weekly, biweekly, or
                  monthly basis.

                  I truly hope that this concept is embraced by my country and
                  that many of my fellow countrymen use it. It is estimated that
                  more than 3 million Ethiopians reside abroad. North America,
                  Europe, and the Gulf are Ethiopian migrants' top destinations.
