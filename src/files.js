      "I strongly recommend them to pay attention to feedback from their customers about any gaps they may have and to narrow them in view of each and every comment they receive from bank customers who use their system. Each user will log in to their account, select a category for their comments, and then type their thoughts about the bank in question along with the branch they are commenting on. ",

This idea came to me when I noticed that most individuals, especially in our country of Ethiopia, complete their projects before conducting any research. I strongly disagree with this style of undertaking and completing tasks.\n So i thought of three platforms to be built ways to conduct the researches and i categorize them in three ways they are like the following : ",
      "Data questionnaire \n This part is handled where the main project will be managed since they mostly want to conduct research on the project that they are going to work on. This one will ensure that all questionnaires are legitimate, available to everyone who will be questioned, and each and every question will have a standard.",
      "This person will be able to input a question in any language they desire, set a measurement, select an item category, and then finally edit, publish, or remove the questions. This provides them complete flexibility while they are creating questionnaires.\n After the questionnaires have been approved and listed with the names, dates, and other statuses of the questions, they will be published.",
      "Mobile-based data collection: \n This will make it easy for other project team members to meet with people, ask them all the questions that have been published, manage their responses, and ask questions in numerous locations because it is a mobile platform. This will lead to better research results.",
      "They can sign up for this smartphone app, and it will list the data collection forms from the organizations with names of the current month and date, items of collected data, and questionnaires. This allows them to sync with the server, and they can then submit the data after validating and submitting the responses for each questionnaire.",
      "Web-based report: \nViewing the data using the information provided here and the following information, such as possible price Inflation expectations and other measurement values\nThere are then filters and historical data by region, time, range, and other filters, followed by charts, graphs, and maybe maps, and finally monthly reports for the research's published data.",
      "Then quickly deliver those data using the file formats of your choice so that everyone may view the study data's values.  ",

      "In order for the anbessa bus transporters to easily access their preferred public bus transportation with their mobile devices, I designed and developed the mobile application. This platform primarily has three sides, which are the passenger, driver, and admin sides. Below, I'll explain some fundamental functionalities for the drivers and passengers.",
      "Anbessa bus passengers: The bus passengers utilize this application to simply find where the bus they needed was heading and be told when it arrived at their destination where they were located. They can also easily find out where the buses are beginning and ending as well as all the intermediate bus stops. They can easily rate the driver, either by complimenting them or by criticizing them if they feel they are not doing a good job. Finally, the most important step is purchasing a ticket. This might be a daily ticket, a package for a week or a month, or a monthly ticket with a discount , and those tickets are scanned by the driver when they enter the bus",
      "Anbessa bus Driver: The bus driver has fewer functionalities than the passengers. He will only log in with his account and if he is assigned a path or road (in our case, the bus number), he will insert that number and start his journey.  The bus driver can read the qr code tickets that the passengers purchased and allow them to board the bus. He can also print manual tickets for those who do not have access to smartphones, which are quite common in our country, and print them for them.",

      "Let's discuss some of the platform's features and services. To start, you can easily create an account, deposit money here from various banks in Ethiopia, and withdraw it as well. You can also see services like loans (SENQ, ENDEKISE, and MELA), each of which has a distinct theme that makes it easy for users to distinguish one service from the others.",

The country has the second biggest population in Africa, with over 50% of people being under 25 years of age.1 Due to the vast size of the population, it is important to recognise that descriptions of Ethiopian cultural customs can vary significantly. There are many distinct cultural practices that are specific to people’s region, ethnicity or religion. Despite this diversity, Ethiopians are generally united by their patriotism and pride in the country’s overarching cultural identity.",
      "Ethiopia is the oldest independent country in Africa, once ruled as a dynasty by a series of monarchs. It is distinct from most other African nations as it is one of the only countries that successfully resisted European colonization. It also has a historical connection to Christianity, with the region adopting the religion before many Western nations were exposed to it. This legacy of the country’s independence and the Ethiopian ‘Tewahedo’ Orthodox Church are very important to Ethiopians’ sense of national pride. Their sense of morality and cultural refinement are shaped by centuries of practice, and continue to inform how they see themselves in the contemporary setting. Generally speaking, Ethiopians are renowned for being welcoming, considerate, cooperative and non-confrontational people.      ",
      "Since I've lived here my entire life, I just wanted to represent my country and give Ethiopian identity to most of the things I do. For example, as you can see, this is the user authentication side for the X-Ethiopia conceptual design. above that, you can see the buildings and monuments in Ethiopia that are immediately recognizable to anyone who sees them, and for those who don't, they will gain a general understanding of Ethiopian culture.

      "Addis Ababa’s parking system is mainly dominated by on-street parking, although there are a few off-street parking areas or parking spaces inside buildings. However, there are no readily accessible parking areas near public transport terminals, which contribute to the inefficient utilization of the road network, especially in terms of road users’ safety and traffic congestion. This, in turn, contributes to higher carbon emissions from vehicles and further impacts on air quality. Addis Ababa’s Transport Programs Management Office (TPMO) is making efforts to solve parking issues through the development of optimized parking systems, particularly with the construction of smart parking systems equipped with modern devices, such as cameras and sensors.",

      "This is a makeover for the college where I previously worked. The previous website was difficult for professors and students to use and did not provide clear information about the institution. I made the new design really attractive in an effort to transform users' first impressions of the college.",
      "They can manage the remaining application procedure and establish each of the services they provide effectively. They can also provide guides for applying to their college.",
      "Thank you for reading this and you can view more on my behance account.",

      "Business-to-business (B2B), also called B-to-B, is a form of transaction between businesses, such as one involving a manufacturer and wholesaler, or a wholesaler and a retailer. Business-to-business refers to business that is conducted between companies, rather than between a company and individual consumer. Business-to-business stands in contrast to business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-government (B2G) transactions.",
      "Business-to-business (B2B) is a transaction or business conducted between one business and another, such as a wholesaler and retailer. B2B transactions tend to happen in the supply chain, where one company will purchase raw materials from another to be used in the manufacturing process. B2B transactions are also commonplace for auto industry companies, as well as property management, housekeeping, and industrial cleanup companies.",
      "Meanwhile, business-to-consumer transactions (B2C) are those made between a company and individual consumers.",
      "Therefore, based on these definitions, there are three platforms that I created for a client: the Distributer side, the Retailer side, and the driver/delivery side of the program. Each of these has its own unique functionalities, and they are all interconnected through other functionalities.",
      "The distributor side is basically the app that contains the inventory and categories, accepts orders from retailers, and packs the orders before delivering them to the retailers. The driving side will accept a request from the distributor and designate him to deliver it to the person who made the request. And the retailer is the one who requests products from the distributor and receives those items through the distributor's designated delivery for use in his job",

      "In order for the anbessa bus transporters to easily access their preferred public bus transportation with their mobile devices, I designed and developed the mobile application. This platform primarily has three sides, which are the passenger, driver, and admin sides. Below, I'll explain some fundamental functionalities for the drivers and passengers.",
      "Anbessa bus passengers: The bus passengers utilize this application to simply find where the bus they needed was heading and be told when it arrived at their destination where they were located. They can also easily find out where the buses are beginning and ending as well as all the intermediate bus stops. They can easily rate the driver, either by complimenting them or by criticizing them if they feel they are not doing a good job. Finally, the most important step is purchasing a ticket. This might be a daily ticket, a package for a week or a month, or a monthly ticket with a discount , and those tickets are scanned by the driver when they enter the bus",
      "Anbessa bus Driver: The bus driver has fewer functionalities than the passengers. He will only log in with his account and if he is assigned a path or road (in our case, the bus number), he will insert that number and start his journey.  The bus driver can read the qr code tickets that the passengers purchased and allow them to board the bus. He can also print manual tickets for those who do not have access to smartphones, which are quite common in our country, and print them for them.",

      "Here is one of my several ideas that I would like to share with you guys. This idea came to me when I noticed that most individuals, especially in our country of Ethiopia, complete their projects before conducting any research. I strongly disagree with this style of undertaking and completing tasks.\n So i thought of three platforms to be built ways to conduct the researches and i categorize them in three ways they are like the following : ",
      "Data questionnaire \n This part is handled where the main project will be managed since they mostly want to conduct research on the project that they are going to work on. This one will ensure that all questionnaires are legitimate, available to everyone who will be questioned, and each and every question will have a standard.",
      "This person will be able to input a question in any language they desire, set a measurement, select an item category, and then finally edit, publish, or remove the questions. This provides them complete flexibility while they are creating questionnaires.\n After the questionnaires have been approved and listed with the names, dates, and other statuses of the questions, they will be published.",
      "Mobile-based data collection: \n This will make it easy for other project team members to meet with people, ask them all the questions that have been published, manage their responses, and ask questions in numerous locations because it is a mobile platform. This will lead to better research results.",

The platform deployed currently has the capacity of processing up to 100 transactions per second (TPS) and can be scaled up to 1000 TPS in the future according to Huawei. The service is accessible via SMS, USSD, and smartphone applications. Telebirr works in five languages.",
      "As a user, I aimed to make some of the steps or flows much easier and more user friendly, and as a UI designer, I made the interface much more attractive and easier to read, and I made it so that it is easier to understand each of the services offered in the telebirr design and that it is more related to Ethiopian culture and modern feeling.",
      "Let's discuss some of the platform's features and services. To start, you can easily create an account, deposit money here from various banks in Ethiopia, and withdraw it as well. You can also see services like loans (SENQ, ENDEKISE, and MELA), each of which has a distinct theme that makes it easy for users to distinguish one service from the others.",
      "Others include the ability for users to easily top up their mobile money and package balances on this platform, pay their house mortgages directly from their homes using this service, and subscribe as volunteers for organizations like the Red Cross, GERD, or other charities they may find appealing.",

      "Ethiopia is located in the Horn of Africa, bordering Sudan, South Sudan, Kenya, Somalia, Eritrea and Djibouti. The country has the second biggest population in Africa, with over 50% of people being under 25 years of age.1 Due to the vast size of the population, it is important to recognise that descriptions of Ethiopian cultural customs can vary significantly. There are many distinct cultural practices that are specific to people’s region, ethnicity or religion. Despite this diversity, Ethiopians are generally united by their patriotism and pride in the country’s overarching cultural identity.",
      "Ethiopia is the oldest independent country in Africa, once ruled as a dynasty by a series of monarchs. It is distinct from most other African nations as it is one of the only countries that successfully resisted European colonization. It also has a historical connection to Christianity, with the region adopting the religion before many Western nations were exposed to it. This legacy of the country’s independence and the Ethiopian ‘Tewahedo’ Orthodox Church are very important to Ethiopians’ sense of national pride. Their sense of morality and cultural refinement are shaped by centuries of practice, and continue to inform how they see themselves in the contemporary setting. Generally speaking, Ethiopians are renowned for being welcoming, considerate, cooperative and non-confrontational people.      ",
      "Since I've lived here my entire life, I just wanted to represent my country and give Ethiopian identity to most of the things I do. For example, as you can see, this is the user authentication side for the X-Ethiopia conceptual design. above that, you can see the buildings and monuments in Ethiopia that are immediately recognizable to anyone who sees them, and for those who don't, they will gain a general understanding of Ethiopian culture.

This, in turn, contributes to higher carbon emissions from vehicles and further impacts on air quality.

They can also easily find out where the buses are beginning and ending as well as all the intermediate bus stops. They can easily rate the driver, either by complimenting them or by criticizing them if they feel they are not doing a good job. Finally, the most important step is purchasing a ticket.

The platform deployed currently has the capacity of processing up to 100 transactions per second (TPS) and can be scaled up to 1000 TPS in the future according to Huawei. The service is accessible via SMS, USSD, and smartphone applications. Telebirr works in five languages.",
      "As a user, I aimed to make some of the steps or flows much easier and more user friendly, and as a UI designer, I made the interface much more attractive and easier to read, and I made it so that it is easier to understand each of the services offered in the telebirr design and that it is more related to Ethiopian culture and modern feeling.",
      "Let's discuss some of the platform's features and services. To start, you can easily create an account, deposit money here from various banks in Ethiopia, and withdraw it as well. You can also see services like loans (SENQ, ENDEKISE, and MELA), each of which has a distinct theme that makes it easy for users to distinguish one service from the others.",
      "Others include the ability for users to easily top up their mobile money and package balances on this platform, pay their house mortgages directly from their homes using this service, and subscribe as volunteers for organizations like the Red Cross, GERD, or other charities they may find appealing.",

      "Ethiopia is located in the Horn of Africa, bordering Sudan, South Sudan, Kenya, Somalia, Eritrea and Djibouti. The country has the second biggest population in Africa, with over 50% of people being under 25 years of age.1 Due to the vast size of the population, it is important to recognise that descriptions of Ethiopian cultural customs can vary significantly. There are many distinct cultural practices that are specific to people’s region, ethnicity or religion. Despite this diversity, Ethiopians are generally united by their patriotism and pride in the country’s overarching cultural identity.",
      "Ethiopia is the oldest independent country in Africa, once ruled as a dynasty by a series of monarchs. It is distinct from most other African nations as it is one of the only countries that successfully resisted European colonization. It also has a historical connection to Christianity, with the region adopting the religion before many Western nations were exposed to it. This legacy of the country’s independence and the Ethiopian ‘Tewahedo’ Orthodox Church are very important to Ethiopians’ sense of national pride. Their sense of morality and cultural refinement are shaped by centuries of practice, and continue to inform how they see themselves in the contemporary setting. Generally speaking, Ethiopians are renowned for being welcoming, considerate, cooperative and non-confrontational people.      ",
      "Since I've lived here my entire life, I just wanted to represent my country and give Ethiopian identity to most of the things I do. For example, as you can see, this is the user authentication side for the X-Ethiopia conceptual design. above that, you can see the buildings and monuments in Ethiopia that are immediately recognizable to anyone who sees them, and for those who don't, they will gain a general understanding of Ethiopian culture.

      "Addis Ababa’s parking system is mainly dominated by on-street parking, although there are a few off-street parking areas or parking spaces inside buildings. However, there are no readily accessible parking areas near public transport terminals, which contribute to the inefficient utilization of the road network, especially in terms of road users’ safety and traffic congestion. This, in turn, contributes to higher carbon emissions from vehicles and further impacts on air quality. Addis Ababa’s Transport Programs Management Office (TPMO) is making efforts to solve parking issues through the development of optimized parking systems, particularly with the construction of smart parking systems equipped with modern devices, such as cameras and sensors.",
